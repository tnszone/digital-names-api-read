Digital Names Overview

A Digital Name is a phonetic identifier allowing a user to tie multiple crypto wallet public keys to a single access point. This allows for an ease of use that is currently not available in the crypto space. Users are enabled, through our Read API, to search the active ledger of names to determine which are taken, and through our Write API to generate new names through 2 different avenues of access: Direct Purchase of a single name or, Credit Exchange which allows the user to bookmark name generation in order to mass generate new names for resale purposes.

Direction of access to buy a name (Direct Purchase):

Create an account on Digitalnames.IO
Purchase a digital name from the checkout system 
Using the Digital Address Book, you may tie this name to any number of address keys, thereby centralizing your wallet addresses for easy access.

Direction of access to generate new names (Credit Exchange)

Create an account on Digitalnames.IO
Purchase access to the Write API 
Utilizing the Commands within the API create layers of security with designated IP access functionality. Find out what access key owns specific names in order to make private purchases.
