Digital Names Overview

A Digital Name is a phonetic identifier allowing a user to tie multiple crypto wallet public keys to a single access point. This allows for an ease of use that is currently not available in the crypto space. Users are enabled, through our Read API, to search the active ledger of names to determine which are taken, and through our Write API to generate new names through 2 different avenues of access: Direct Purchase of a single name or, Credit Exchange which allows the user to bookmark name generation in order to mass generate new names for resale purposes.
